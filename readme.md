## Developer Setup

1. Go to spotify's developer dashboard and create an app for the web API - [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Make sure the redirect is just to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`
3. Take the `client_id` and `client_secret` from your app and put them in a `.env` file similar to [.env.template](./.env.template)
4. Start cooking üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥

## TODO

- handle when topTracks or topArtists are empty (display - "not enough data")
- loading state for the copy button to show it's still loading
- clickable items in splist that lead back to artist/track
- blue heart for manpreeet
- hover stuff and logic for heart like vercel.lol

## Notes

- image top tracks gets cut off if the width of contents ends up being to long for the overall width (solution is to just increase overall width)
